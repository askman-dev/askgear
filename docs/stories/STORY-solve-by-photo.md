**When** I click "Solve by Photo", upload the picture, and confirm the recognized problem
**Then** the application should automatically navigate to a dedicated solving session interface
**And** the interface should display my problem image and question, while the AI begins its explanation.

### Scenario 2: Solving Session is Automatically Saved

**Given that** I have started a solving session via a photo
